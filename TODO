1) _InjectPid has issues, they can be fixed by switching to a threaded injection
2) Port PEpatcher (mabey just use msvcrt)
3) Get Shelly working
4) migratable shell (requires 1+3)
5) give the dll a shell that provides access to exports (use stuff from interactive_dll_injector) (big task)
6) Port libUnity crypto code
